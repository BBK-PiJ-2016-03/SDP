### (a) What is the Facade Pattern? ###

The Facade pattern is a pattern to provide a simplification of access to
one or more dependency or api calls.

### (b) When, and why, would you use the Facade Pattern? ###

You would want to use the facade pattern to decouple a class from a
complex dependency, and replace it with with a simplified abstraction.
This could involve combining a set of api or method calls into a simpler
combined method, or hiding complexity of a large api that is not needed.
